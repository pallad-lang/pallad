## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to <pallad.lang@outlook.com>.

After reporting a vulnerability, you can expect an initial response within a reasonable time that acknowledges receipt and indicates whether the report has been accepted as a valid, in-scope vulnerability or declined (for example, because it is out of scope or not reproducible). You can then expect at least a status update within one week, which, where possible, will include information about planned fixes or mitigation steps and, if known, an estimated timeline for their delivery.
